# Websites
I am making some websites for practice. I am updating almost everyday because I am making more and more cool things into the pratice website. If you actually want to see how I progress everyday with my website. You have to download every day at night. But I think everybody will not do that. They will download once and I am like it that way. I have actually made a website that has a url, i don't think you'll believe this, it was ACTUALLY hard to make a website with wordpress. So I just switched to coding. And look how my website should have looked if I coded! I did not expect this result. Just watching a few youtube video to get help, I have made this website! I will progress very slowly and eventually release a new website when I finally decided that it was the last update. Also, after you download it, make sure to extract all the files into the file you want it to go to. Hope you all enjoy the website and upcoming websites! üòÅüëå
